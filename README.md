# Meta_Front-End_Developer_Capstone
This repository showcases my capstone project from the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate course. The project demonstrates my skills and knowledge acquired during the program. The website is hosted using Firebase Hosting, which wasn't required, but I have provided the link for anyone interested in viewing it.

Please note that I have chosen not to include the code in this repository. Unfortunately, there have been many people copying and claiming my code as their own, which is truly sad to see.
